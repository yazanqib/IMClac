# IMClac
This  MATLAB application calculates the essential parameters for 3-Phase Induction Motor (IM) to help in modelling the used motor, it provides the necessary parameters to model DOL operation or design your vector controller. 
It is a smiple interface just add the values as shown in motor plate.
<b>Main calculated parameters</b>: Rotor Current, Rotor( Current , Resistance, Inductance,)Magnetizing (Current, Inductance), Stator and Rotor Time Constants.
