# IMClac
This  MATLAB application calculates the main parameters for 3-Phase Induction Motor (IM) to  be used later in modeling or simulations, it provides the necessary parameters to model DOL operation or design your vector controller. 

<b>Main calculated parameters</b>: Rotor Current, Rotor( Current , Resistance, Inductance,)Magnetizing (Current, Inductance), Stator and Rotor Time Constants.
